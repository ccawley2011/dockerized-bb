# Unlike the other packages, for some reason libmad does not
# auto-apply quilt patches from the debian directory, which are
# needed to (among other things) avoid compilation failures due to
# the use of a flag `-fforce-mem`` which was removed in GCC 4.3.

# libmad has an outdated autotools config which does not know of androideabi,
# so replace it with a new one
